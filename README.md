# odooConfirm
This script is a Python-based automation tool that utilizes Selenium for web navigation and interaction. More specifically, it's made to automate mechanical tasks (such as the confirmation of quotations, the confirmations of sale orders etc..) in the Odoo interface.

## Usage
This script collection is particularly useful for automating repetitive web interaction tasks on the sales pages, especially those involving form submissions and dynamic content handling.

Simply clone the repository and run the `main.py` file through either the `run.bat` file on windows, or through the `run.sh` file on mac.

```$ git clone https://github.com/ItsYaBoiSimonx/odooConfirm``` 

> [!NOTE]  
> Ensure you have both Python and pip working and added to path. All should work well if you do. This script was made for Odoo v17.0, I haven't tested any other version.
